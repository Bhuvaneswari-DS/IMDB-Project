# IMDB-Project
Here i have uploaded my IMDB movie filteration and visualisation using Selenium, webdriver for extracting web page from website.
Then we try to click load more button to show after 50 movies using def function, try & except also.
Next step to extract the path from the movie page's click on inspect to get the HTML using xpath copy to include in our selenium code.
We run that, then it takes somemore time, then we get the output as 1000 to 5000 movies as per our internet connectivity.
Then we clean it using import RE package, as per mentioned in the documentation. Finally cleaned movies including movie name,ratings,voting,duration & genres.
Connect with sql using install pymysql, sqlalchemy.
Create a proper environment for streamlit, get knowledge from video.
One another page with install streamlit, seaborn, matplotlib, pyplot.express, again get data from sql to run through streamlit.
With proper coding to show the presentation in easily understandable sliding, barchart, scatter chart and so on. Run the streamlit to show the final output.
